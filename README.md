# Differentiable Search of Evolutionary Trees from Leaves

(This repo will be further organized for ease of use)

Pre-print - https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.23.550206v1

Our work introduces a differentiable approach to phylogenetic tree construction, optimizing both tree and ancestral sequences.

#### **Checklist**

* Make sure to select GPU (or remove the `-g 0` flag when running)
* You can specify your wandb account if you intend to log statistics/tree illustrations


#### **Example : running for trees with 16 leaves**

* To run for different number of leaves change the -l to the desired value

Other params :

* sequence length : `-sl`
* mutations per bifurcation : `-m`
* alphabet size : `-nl`
* epochs/steps : `-e`
* initialization count to run in parallel : `-ic`

During running, every 200 steps it will print the `soft_parsimony_score` and `parsimony_score` (last two values in each line)

```bash
!python train_batch_implicit_diff.py -l 16 -nl 20 -m 50 -sl 256 -tLs [0,0.005,10,50] -lr 0.1 -lr_seq 0.01 -t float64-multi-init-run -p Batch-Run-Maximum-Parsimony -alt -n "Final Run" -g 0 -e 5000 -ai 1 -ic 50 -s 42
```

##### Current Limitations : 

- [ ] Groundtruth trees we evaluate against (optimal solutions) are complete binary trees. We need to evaluate on diverse grountruth trees of uneven leaf levels (incomplete binary trees)
- [ ] Get rid of site-wise independence assumption

We are working on these aspects in another repo : https://github.com/ramithuh/differentiable-trees.
Once those are tested and verified, this repo will be updated.
